circa is a minimalist macOS menu bar app that helps you build and maintain daily task habits


## why build this?

most productivity apps are trying to do everything and it got a little bit overwhelming - so i made this

it has
- calendar view of the current month
- inline todo/task management
- streak count for each task (viewable on calendar + task list)

all in a single popover of mac's menu bar

ps. data is stored locally using  ```UserDefaults``` so no login needed, ever.


## installation

clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circa.git
cd circa
```

open the project in xcode
